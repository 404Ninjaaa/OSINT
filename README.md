# OSINT
This is a GUI based OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool written in python with a user-friendly interface. It lets you gather information about IP addresses, domains, and usernames. You can do things like find subdomains, get location details of IPs, check DNS records, see who owns a domain (WHOIS), and much more. 

There are multiple features available in this tool. As a sample, I have used my own username to check whether it exists on multiple websites. If the tool finds the account, it automatically takes a screenshot and saves it in a folder called OSINT_DATA.
