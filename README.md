# OSINT
This is a GUI based OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool written in python with a user-friendly interface. It lets you gather information about IP addresses, domains, and usernames. You can do things like find subdomains, get location details of IPs, check DNS records, see who owns a domain (WHOIS), and much more. 

There are multiple features available in this tool. As a sample, I have used my own username to check whether it exists on multiple websites. If the tool finds the account, it automatically takes a screenshot and saves it in a folder called OSINT_DATA.

Not only can it perform user reconnaissance, but it can also do much more—such as WHOIS lookups and subdomain discovery. It even takes screenshots of live subdomains, which saves time compared to checking each one manually. To make the tool more user-friendly, I’ve used multiple colors to indicate different results.

To make it user-friendly, this program automatically organizes the results by distinguishing whether it’s a user or a subdomain.
